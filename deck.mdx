  <div>What about TDD, BDD, and DDD?</div>

<Notes>
  TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very
  short development cycle. 
  BDD also writes tests before code. BDD writes tests from the users perspective? More on BDD in out example.
  OPINION: When your boss hands you a big project... say adding an additional page to you app with a lot of logic that your going
  to have to create. My thought is to create a unit test(that fails) create the
  function to pass the test and then create the next unit test etc etc...

<Notes>
  Using BDD we would ask. How is the user interaction with this function? Will
  they be entering the 2 input values? If they will enter them, will the input
  have safe guards to prevent strings, or booleans values?

    { range: [5, 8], notes: "Access data from the parent component." },
    { notes: "Imagine this broke out into individual files." }
  ]}
  />;

<Notes>
In this example we are using setContext to show how easily data can be passed from a parent to child component(s). If your not familiar with the context API or Redux this can be a little intimidating at first glance. I'm going to try to hit some of the high points, but check the docs for more detail on the context api.
CLICK!
createContext creates a context object. A context object is like a store for data. You can add data in one component and access it in another component. 
CLICK!
The parent component App will be where the value is set. 
CLICK!
Display will retrieved the value from the store. 
CLICK!
In the example this is all in 1 file, but if this would have been a production app I would have seperated this into 1 file for the context, 1 file for the App component and 1 file for the Display component. Remember I don't have to access the value in Display. I could have easily had another component nested inside Display that was accessing the value from App.

Opinion
I feel like this is one area where React has stole an idea from angular. I think one of the pain points of React has always been how to deal with passing data around and I feel l ike the context api was a great first step and this helps make it a little more accessible.

# Advanced Hooks

---

<Notes>
In this example we are using multiple setState's and useEffect. 
CLICK!
You can set setState to an initialValue. One example I have seen is declaring a variable initVal and using it for all instances of useState, then you can test for the initial value in your component to make sure it is initialized properly.
CLICK!
addEventlisteners 
CLICK!
Remember this get's fired when the component is unmounted.
CLICK!
In thie effect we are firing the event OnMount. If this is updating state why isn't it an infinite loop?
CLICK!
When you pass an empty array to useEffect it stops the effect from rerendering. If you had an array of numerous items you could pass a 2nd argument that say updates a single object going forward.

Opinion
I have to say I work in Angular all day, and we don't have console errors about memory leaks, but I'm impressed with the error messages that react emits when it detects a memory leak.

# Summary of Hooks

<div style={{ fontSize: 60, textAlign: "left" }}>
  <ul>
    <Appear>
      <li>Code is more readable.</li>
      <li>Easier to test.</li>
      <li>Faster in Prod(In Theory).</li>
      <li>Custom Hooks could be a game changer. I hate that term!</li>
    </Appear>
  </ul>
</div>

<Notes>
  Your code is more readable, because hooks allow us to break out our logic more
  cleanly and concisely. One of the side benefits of smaller components is it is
  a lot easier to test. Hooks are better optimez for minification, which in
  theory should reduce the bundle size and make it a little more performant. I
  don't think we quite understand the full potential of custom hooks. I've seem
  a few interesting ideas around custom hooks, but I don't think we fully
  understand what can be done yet. Last Point) Tell story about what we are
  doing with our project at work. (Refactoring certain areas ... hitting the
  growing pains). If your at that point with your app use hooks when you
  refactor, but I wouldn't refactor a prod app just to use hooks.
