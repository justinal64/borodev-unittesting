  <div>What about TDD, BDD, and DDD?</div>
</div>

<Notes>
  TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very
  short development cycle. 
  BDD also writes tests before code. BDD writes tests from the users perspective? More on BDD in out example.
  What is TDD??????
  OPINION: When your boss hands you a big project... say adding an additional page to you app with a lot of logic that your going
  to have to create. My thought is to create a unit test(that fails) create the
  function to pass the test and then create the next unit test etc etc...

<Notes>
  Using BDD we would ask. How is the user interaction with this function? Will
  they be entering the 2 input values? If they will enter them, will the input
  have safe guards to prevent strings, or booleans values?

  <div>My Thoughts on Unit Testing</div>
</div>
<Notes>
  1) Unit testing is like picking a framework. There are a lot of options to choose from, but do your research and use the one you like best.
  2) Like learning a new framework your going to make mistakes. Your going to write crappy tests. Keep going! 
  3) When QA sends your code back with a bug learn from the mistake and write a test to cover the usecase they found. Testing is not going to replace QA.
  4) The more tests you write the better your tests will be and the more bug you will catch before they get to QA or worse PROD!
  5) TODO: What else????
